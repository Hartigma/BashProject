# BashProject

# This projects goal is to combine two or more files into one for convience 
# the use case is limitless, however lets say we are storing over 10k IP addresses in each file, this script would make it easy to combine the two instead of going
# into the text file and taking the extra long time to copy each.

# The script has 3 menu options, this includes a repeat option, an explanation option, or an exit, maybe you dont want to use this script afterall.

# The script then creates or overwrites the combined text adding the two text files in this directory together. First the script is checking if they exist, if this is the case the script will go through and create the files. Luckily using this directory the 2 text files will always exist.

# Regex is provided in the script to document the date and time of execution

# the final display uses a cat to display the contents of the cat folder, this can be used to verify the file combined the two text files.
